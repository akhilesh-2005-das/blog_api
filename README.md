Full-Stack MERN Blog Project: Retro-Board üöÄThis is a complete full-stack blog application named Retro-Board, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It was created as a minor project for a full-stack development class.The application features a secure RESTful API backend that handles user authentication with JWT and manages blog post data. The frontend is a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite, allowing users to register, log in, and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own posts.üåê Live Links & Test CredentialsYou can test the fully deployed application right now!Live Frontend: https://frontend-blog-api.onrender.com/Live Backend API: https://backend-blog-api-iktj.onrender.com/üß™ Try it out!Feel free to register as a new user or use these test credentials to log in:Email: local@example.comPassword: 12345‚ú® Key FeaturesSecure User Authentication: Full registration and login system.Password Hashing: Passwords are never stored in plain text, using bcryptjs for one-way hashing.JWT Authorization: The API is secured using JSON Web Tokens. Protected routes require a valid token.Full CRUD for Posts:Create: Logged-in users can create new blog posts.Read: All users (guests included) can read all posts.Update: Users can only edit their own posts.Delete: Users can only delete their own posts.Author-Only Permissions: The backend validates that the user making an edit/delete request is the original author.Responsive Frontend: The React UI, built with Tailwind CSS, is fully responsive.Global State Management: Uses React's Context API to manage the user's authentication state.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackCategoryTechnologyDescriptionFrontendReact (Vite)JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React RouterFor client-side routing and page navigation.Tailwind CSSA utility-first CSS framework for styling.AxiosFor making HTTP requests to the backend API.React Context APIFor managing global authentication state.BackendNode.jsJavaScript runtime environment.Express.jsWeb framework for building the RESTful API.MongoDBNoSQL database for storing user and post data.MongooseODM library for modeling data in MongoDB.JWT (jsonwebtoken)For creating and verifying user auth tokens.bcryptjsFor hashing and comparing passwords.DeploymentRender.comCloud platform for deploying the backend & frontend.üèÅ Getting Started (Local Development)To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.PrerequisitesNode.js (which includes npm)A MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)Postman (Recommended for testing the API)1. Backend Setup (/server folder)Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name/server
Install dependencies:npm install
Create your environment file:Create a file named .env in the /server directory and add the following variables:# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here

# A strong, random secret for signing tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_secret_key_here

# Port for the server to run on
PORT=5000
Run the server:# Runs the server with nodemon (auto-restarts on changes)
npm run dev
The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:5000.2. Frontend Setup (/client folder)Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:cd ../client
Install dependencies:npm install
Set API URL:Go to client/src/api/api.js (or your equivalent Axios config file) and change the baseURL to your local backend:baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000/api',Run the client:# Starts the Vite development server
npm run dev
Your React app will open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:5173.üìñ API EndpointsAll endpoints are prefixed with /api.Auth RoutesMethodEndpointDescriptionPOST/auth/registerRegister a new user.POST/auth/loginLog in a user and receive a JWT.Post RoutesMethodEndpointDescriptionAccessGET/postsGet all blog posts.PublicPOST/postsCreate a new blog post.PrivatePUT/posts/:idUpdate a specific post.Private (Author only)DELETE/posts/:idDelete a specific post.Private (Author only)
